# Spigot-Plugins
This is where I store some of the files for my open source plugins.

Feel free to use any of my code, but if you take a big chunk, or any other thing you deem apropriate to give credit for, please give me credit :)

I do this in my free time, as well as whatever my spastic mind wants to do. 

Regards,
-Fisher
